```

## Installation

Use rusts package manger to install gyst-tui.

```
cargo install gyst-tui
```

## Dependencies

This tool doesn't have any mandatory dependencies. However, it looks much better if you install [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) for better icons. If you don't want to do so, you can always use your own icons or change them for plain text, like `[ ]` for an incomplete task and `[x]` for a complete task.

## Config

The config file can be found in:
- Unix: `~/.config/gyst-tui/settings.json`
- Windows: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\gyst-tui\settings.json`

There are some pre-built commands you can run to change the configuration. For example, you can change the keybindings to `vi` mode by running:

```
gyst-tui config --mode vi
```

You can also enable special icons by running:

```
gyst-tui config --icons special
```

For all the configuration options, run:

```
gyst-tui config help
```

Optionally, you can change the default configuration by editing the files directly. The default config is the following:

```
gyst-tui config --show
```

```json
{
  "date_formats": {
    "display_date_format": "%a %b %-d",
    "display_datetime_format": "%a %b %-d at %-H:%M",

## Key Bindings

All key bindings can be modified in the config file. The defaults have been chosen to mimic vim movements as best as possible. Feel free to modify them to your liking!

**List of tasks panel**

| Key Bindings | Description                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `q`          | Quits the application                                                     |
| `Down`       | Moves down one task                                                       |

| `n`          | Opens the new task page                                                   |

| `Enter`      | If the task has an associated link, it opens it in your preferred browser |
| `Right`      | Select next group                                                         |

**Editing/new task panel**

This panel has two modes (similar to vim). When you are in insert mode, you can modify the fields to edit or create a task. When you are in normal mode, you can move around the fields, save the tasks, go back, or quit.

*Normal mode*

| Key Bindings | Description                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `q`          | Quit the application               |
| `Down`       | Move down to the next field        |
| `Up`         | Move up to the previous field      |
| `i`          | Enter insert mode                  |
| `Esc`        | Go back to the list of tasks panel |
| `Enter`      | Save changes or add the new task   |

*Insert mode*

| Key Bindings | Description                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Esc`        | Exit insert mode / go back to normal mode |

## Why the CLI?

CLI access to your todos introduces a programmatic way to modify or display your todos in comfortable places. For developers, this might mean displaying your todos when you open your terminal, as notifications, or even or your menu bar. For me, the menu bar was what drove me to create this project. I have used the app Cron for a bit and loved being able to see my events for that day without opening anything. So I created my own SketchyBar widget to interact with my todos:
